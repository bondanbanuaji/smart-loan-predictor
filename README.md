# 💳 K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Loan Eligibility Prediction

A Streamlit-based web application that uses the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to predict loan eligibility based on user financial and demographic data.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Interactive web interface built with **Streamlit**
- Predicts loan eligibility using a pre-trained **KNN model**
- Real-time input form for age, income, job, and loan details
- 3D visualization of simulated KNN data using **Plotly**
- Clean, responsive layout with modern UI

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- **Python 3.12+**
- **Streamlit** – Frontend & dashboard framework  
- **Plotly** – Interactive visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning model  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data processing
